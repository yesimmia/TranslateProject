Codecademy vs. BBC微型计算机
======

20世纪70年代末，计算机这个过去几十年中一直只为企业巨头所用的神秘笨重机器，突然变成了普通人可以买到并带回家的东西。少数满怀热情的人发现了这件事情有多么的了不起，赶紧买了一台属于他们自己的计算机。而对于更多的人来说，微型计算机的到来引发了对未来的无助和焦虑感。当时一本杂志上的广告承诺，家用电脑将 “让你的孩子在学校拥有他人没有的优势”。广告中，一个身穿精巧西装、打着领带的男孩热切地举手回答问题，而他身后那些愚蠢的同学则闷闷不乐地看着。这则广告和其他类似的广告表明，世界正在迅速变化，如果你不立即学习如何使用一个令人生畏的新设备，你和你的家人就会被甩在后面。

在英国，这种焦虑演变为了政府领导层对国家竞争力的担忧。总的来说，在英国，20世纪70年代是令人失望的十年。通货膨胀和失业率都很高。同时，一系列的罢工使伦敦经历了一次又一次的停电。1979年的一份政府报告中表达了这样的担忧，如果不能跟上计算机技术的发展趋势，那么“我们糟糕的工业表现将雪上加霜”。[1][1]当时英国在计算机领域似乎已经落后了——所有的大计算机公司都是美国公司，而集成电路则由日本和台湾组装。

由英国政府资助的公共服务广播公司BBC决定采取一项大胆地举措，帮助各地的英国人克服对计算机的厌恶，解决英国国家竞争力不足的问题。BBC启动了计算机扫盲项目，这是一项多管齐下的教育工作，内容包括几部电视连续剧、几本书、一个支持小组网络，以及一台被称为BBC Micro的特制微型计算机。该项目大获成功，1983年，《BYTE》杂志的一位编辑写道：“与美国相比，英国对微型计算机感兴趣的人口比例更高。”[2][2]这位编辑大为惊叹的是，英国举行的第五届世界个人电脑展的参与人数比那一年西海岸电脑节的参与人数还多。超过六分之一的英国人观看了“_计算机扫盲项目_”中制作的第一个系列节目，最终售出了150万台BBC微型计算机（BBC Micro）。[3][3]

去年，网上发布了[一个档案][4]，涵盖了“_计算机扫盲计划_”中制作的每部电视剧和发表的所有材料。我看了这些电视剧，觉得非常有趣，并试图想象在20世纪80年代初学习计算机是什么样子。但事实证明，更有趣的是计算机的*教授*方法。今天，我们仍然担心人们追赶不上技术的发展。富有的科技企业家和政府花了很多钱试图教孩子们 "编程"。我们有像Codecademy这样的网站，利用新技术交互式教授编码。人们会认为这种方法比80年代的呆板电视连续剧更有效。但真的如此吗？

### 计算机扫盲项目

微型计算机革命始于1975年[Altair 8800][5]的发布。仅仅两年后，苹果II、TRS-80和Commodore PET就都发布了。新计算机销量激增。1978年，英国广播公司（BBC）在一部名为“Now the Chips Are Down”的纪录片中探讨了这些新机器肯定会带来的巨大的社会变化。

这部纪录片令人担忧。在开头五分钟里，解说员解释说，微电子技术将“彻底改变我们的生活方式”。随着阴森的合成器音乐响起，绿色的电脉冲围绕着屏幕上放大的微处理器跳动，解说员说，新的芯片是 "日本放弃造船的原因，也会让我们的孩子长大后没有工作。" 纪录片接着探讨了人们如何利用机器人实现了汽车装配自动化，以及欧洲制表业如何输给了美国的数字手表制造商。这部纪录片指责英国政府没有采取更多措施为英国未来的大规模失业做准备。

这部纪录片是给英国内阁看的。[4][6]英国工业部、人力服务委员会等政府机构开始试图提升英国公众对计算机的认识。人力服务委员会为BBC教育部门的一个小组提供资金，让他们到日本、美国和其他国家进行实况调查。这个研究小组编写了一份报告，分类说明微电子技术将如何使工业制造、劳动关系和办公室工作领域发生重大变化。1979年底，BBC决定制作一个十集的电视连续剧，帮助普通英国人“学习如何使用和控制计算机，而不是感觉被计算机支配”。[5][7]该项目最终成为了一个多媒体项目，类似于*成人扫盲项目*，成人扫盲项目是BBC的一个早期项目，内容包括电视剧和辅助课程，帮助了200万人提高他们的阅读能力。

*计算机扫盲项目*背后的制作人希望在电视系列节目中展示“动手实践”的例子，如果观众家里有一台微型计算机，就可以自己尝试。这些例子必须使用BASIC语言，因为那是几乎所有微型计算机上使用的语言（实际上是整个外壳）。但制作人面临着一个棘手的问题：不同微型计算机制造商使用的BASIC语言不同，所以无论他们选择哪种，都会不可避免地影响一部分观众。唯一真正的解决办法是创建一个新的BASIC语言——BBC BASIC——以及一个与之配套的微型计算机。英国公众将能够购买这种新的微型计算机，跟着节目操作，不必担心软件和硬件的差异。

BBC的电视制作人和主持人自己没有能力建造微型计算机。因此，他们为心目中的计算机制定了规格，邀请英国微型计算机公司设计符合要求的新机器。这一规格下的计算机功能相对强大，因为BBC的制作人认为，这种计算机要能运行真正实用的应用程序。*计算机扫盲项目*的技术顾问还建议，既然这个计算机使用的是要教给全国人民的BASIC语言，那么这种BASIC语言最好是好用的。(他们可能没有完全像这样措辞，但我打赌他们就是这样想的)。BBC BASIC将允许递归和局部变量，弥补BASIC语言的常见的一些缺点[6][8]。

BBC最终决定由一家名为Acorn计算机的剑桥公司来制造BBC Micro。BBC选择了Acorn，放弃了Sinclair Research公司经营者Clive Sinclair的提案。1980年，Sinclair Research公司推出的Sinclair ZX80打开了英国微型计算机的大众市场。Sinclair的新计算机ZX81很便宜，但功能不够强大，无法满足BBC的需求。Acorn的新原型计算机内部代号Proton，价格更贵，但功能更强大，可以扩展，令BBC的人员印象深刻。Proton并未以Proton的名字上市或销售，而是在1981年12月以“BBC Micro”的名称发布，也被亲切地称为“The Beeb”。16K版本售价为235英镑，32K版本售价为335英镑。

1980年，Acorn在英国计算机行业中处于劣势，但BBC Micro让该公司对行业发展产生了影响。今天，世界上最流行的微处理器指令集是ARM架构。“ARM”现在代表“Advanced RISC Machine”，但它最初代表的是“Acorn RISC Machine”。该架构背后的ARM控股公司是1990年从Acorn脱离出来的。

### The Computer Programme

A dozen different TV series were eventually produced as part of the _Computer Literacy Project_, but the first of them was a ten-part series known as _The Computer Programme_. The series was broadcast over ten weeks at the beginning of 1982. A million people watched each week-night broadcast of the show; a quarter million watched the reruns on Sunday and Monday afternoon.

The show was hosted by two presenters, Chris Serle and Ian McNaught-Davis. Serle plays the neophyte while McNaught-Davis, who had professional experience programming mainframe computers, plays the expert. This was an inspired setup. It made for [awkward transitions][10]—Serle often goes directly from a conversation with McNaught-Davis to a bit of walk-and-talk narration delivered to the camera, and you can’t help but wonder whether McNaught-Davis is still standing there out of frame or what. But it meant that Serle could voice the concerns that the audience would surely have. He can look intimidated by a screenful of BASIC and can ask questions like, “What do all these dollar signs mean?” At several points during the show, Serle and McNaught-Davis sit down in front of a computer and essentially pair program, with McNaught-Davis providing hints here and there while Serle tries to figure it out. It would have been much less relatable if the show had been presented by a single, all-knowing narrator.

The show also made an effort to demonstrate the many practical applications of computing in the lives of regular people. By the early 1980s, the home computer had already begun to be associated with young boys and video games. The producers behind _The Computer Programme_ sought to avoid interviewing “impressively competent youngsters,” as that was likely “to increase the anxieties of older viewers,” a demographic that the show was trying to attract to computing.[7][11] In the first episode of the series, Gill Nevill, the show’s “on location” reporter, interviews a woman that has bought a Commodore PET to help manage her sweet shop. The woman (her name is Phyllis) looks to be 60-something years old, yet she has no trouble using the computer to do her accounting and has even started using her PET to do computer work for other businesses, which sounds like the beginning of a promising freelance career. Phyllis says that she wouldn’t mind if the computer work grew to replace her sweet shop business since she enjoys the computer work more. This interview could instead have been an interview with a teenager about how he had modified _Breakout_ to be faster and more challenging. But that would have been encouraging to almost nobody. On the other hand, if Phyllis, of all people, can use a computer, then surely you can too.

While the show features lots of BASIC programming, what it really wants to teach its audience is how computing works in general. The show explains these general principles with analogies. In the second episode, there is an extended discussion of the Jacquard loom, which accomplishes two things. First, it illustrates that computers are not based only on magical technology invented yesterday—some of the foundational principles of computing go back two hundred years and are about as simple as the idea that you can punch holes in card to control a weaving machine. Second, the interlacing of warp and weft threads is used to demonstrate how a binary choice (does the weft thread go above or below the warp thread?) is enough, when repeated over and over, to produce enormous variation. This segues, of course, into a discussion of how information can be stored using binary digits.

Later in the show there is a section about a steam organ that plays music encoded in a long, segmented roll of punched card. This time the analogy is used to explain subroutines in BASIC. Serle and McNaught-Davis lay out the whole roll of punched card on the floor in the studio, then point out the segments where it looks like a refrain is being repeated. McNaught-Davis explains that a subroutine is what you would get if you cut out those repeated segments of card and somehow added an instruction to go back to the original segment that played the refrain for the first time. This is a brilliant explanation and probably one that stuck around in people’s minds for a long time afterward.

I’ve picked out only a few examples, but I think in general the show excels at demystifying computers by explaining the principles that computers rely on to function. The show could instead have focused on teaching BASIC, but it did not. This, it turns out, was very much a conscious choice. In a retrospective written in 1983, John Radcliffe, the executive producer of the _Computer Literacy Project_, wrote the following:

> If computers were going to be as important as we believed, some genuine understanding of this new subject would be important for everyone, almost as important perhaps as the capacity to read and write. Early ideas, both here and in America, had concentrated on programming as the main route to computer literacy. However, as our thinking progressed, although we recognized the value of “hands-on” experience on personal micros, we began to place less emphasis on programming and more on wider understanding, on relating micros to larger machines, encouraging people to gain experience with a range of applications programs and high-level languages, and relating these to experience in the real world of industry and commerce…. Our belief was that once people had grasped these principles, at their simplest, they would be able to move further forward into the subject.

Later, Radcliffe writes, in a similar vein:

> There had been much debate about the main explanatory thrust of the series. One school of thought had argued that it was particularly important for the programmes to give advice on the practical details of learning to use a micro. But we had concluded that if the series was to have any sustained educational value, it had to be a way into the real world of computing, through an explanation of computing principles. This would need to be achieved by a combination of studio demonstration on micros, explanation of principles by analogy, and illustration on film of real-life examples of practical applications. Not only micros, but mini computers and mainframes would be shown.

I love this, particularly the part about mini-computers and mainframes. The producers behind _The Computer Programme_ aimed to help Britons get situated: Where had computing been, and where was it going? What can computers do now, and what might they do in the future? Learning some BASIC was part of answering those questions, but knowing BASIC alone was not seen as enough to make someone computer literate.

### Computer Literacy Today

If you google “learn to code,” the first result you see is a link to Codecademy’s website. If there is a modern equivalent to the _Computer Literacy Project_, something with the same reach and similar aims, then it is Codecademy.

“Learn to code” is Codecademy’s tagline. I don’t think I’m the first person to point this out—in fact, I probably read this somewhere and I’m now ripping it off—but there’s something revealing about using the word “code” instead of “program.” It suggests that the important thing you are learning is how to decode the code, how to look at a screen’s worth of Python and not have your eyes glaze over. I can understand why to the average person this seems like the main hurdle to becoming a professional programmer. Professional programmers spend all day looking at computer monitors covered in gobbledygook, so, if I want to become a professional programmer, I better make sure I can decipher the gobbledygook. But dealing with syntax is not the most challenging part of being a programmer, and it quickly becomes almost irrelevant in the face of much bigger obstacles. Also, armed only with knowledge of a programming language’s syntax, you may be able to _read_ code but you won’t be able to _write_ code to solve a novel problem.

I recently went through Codecademy’s “Code Foundations” course, which is the course that the site recommends you take if you are interested in programming (as opposed to web development or data science) and have never done any programming before. There are a few lessons in there about the history of computer science, but they are perfunctory and poorly researched. (Thank heavens for [this noble internet vigilante][12], who pointed out a particularly egregious error.) The main focus of the course is teaching you about the common structural elements of programming languages: variables, functions, control flow, loops. In other words, the course focuses on what you would need to know to start seeing patterns in the gobbledygook.

To be fair to Codecademy, they offer other courses that look meatier. But even courses such as their “Computer Science Path” course focus almost exclusively on programming and concepts that can be represented in programs. One might argue that this is the whole point—Codecademy’s main feature is that it gives you little interactive programming lessons with automated feedback. There also just isn’t enough room to cover more because there is only so much you can stuff into somebody’s brain in a little automated lesson. But the producers at the BBC tasked with kicking off the _Computer Literacy Project_ also had this problem; they recognized that they were limited by their medium and that “the amount of learning that would take place as a result of the television programmes themselves would be limited.”[8][13] With similar constraints on the volume of information they could convey, they chose to emphasize general principles over learning BASIC. Couldn’t Codecademy replace a lesson or two with an interactive visualization of a Jacquard loom weaving together warp and weft threads?

I’m banging the drum for “general principles” loudly now, so let me just explain what I think they are and why they are important. There’s a book by J. Clark Scott about computers called _But How Do It Know?_ The title comes from the anecdote that opens the book. A salesman is explaining to a group of people that a thermos can keep hot food hot and cold food cold. A member of the audience, astounded by this new invention, asks, “But how do it know?” The joke of course is that the thermos is not perceiving the temperature of the food and then making a decision—the thermos is just constructed so that cold food inevitably stays cold and hot food inevitably stays hot. People anthropomorphize computers in the same way, believing that computers are digital brains that somehow “choose” to do one thing or another based on the code they are fed. But learning a few things about how computers work, even at a rudimentary level, takes the homunculus out of the machine. That’s why the Jacquard loom is such a good go-to illustration. It may at first seem like an incredible device. It reads punch cards and somehow “knows” to weave the right pattern! The reality is mundane: Each row of holes corresponds to a thread, and where there is a hole in that row the corresponding thread gets lifted. Understanding this may not help you do anything new with computers, but it will give you the confidence that you are not dealing with something magical. We should impart this sense of confidence to beginners as soon as we can.

Alas, it’s possible that the real problem is that nobody wants to learn about the Jacquard loom. Judging by how Codecademy emphasizes the professional applications of what it teaches, many people probably start using Codecademy because they believe it will help them “level up” their careers. They believe, not unreasonably, that the primary challenge will be understanding the gobbledygook, so they want to “learn to code.” And they want to do it as quickly as possible, in the hour or two they have each night between dinner and collapsing into bed. Codecademy, which after all is a business, gives these people what they are looking for—not some roundabout explanation involving a machine invented in the 18th century.

The _Computer Literacy Project_, on the other hand, is what a bunch of producers and civil servants at the BBC thought would be the best way to educate the nation about computing. I admit that it is a bit elitist to suggest we should laud this group of people for teaching the masses what they were incapable of seeking out on their own. But I can’t help but think they got it right. Lots of people first learned about computing using a BBC Micro, and many of these people went on to become successful software developers or game designers. [As I’ve written before][14], I suspect learning about computing at a time when computers were relatively simple was a huge advantage. But perhaps another advantage these people had is shows like _The Computer Programme_, which strove to teach not just programming but also how and why computers can run programs at all. After watching _The Computer Programme_, you may not understand all the gobbledygook on a computer screen, but you don’t really need to because you know that, whatever the “code” looks like, the computer is always doing the same basic thing. After a course or two on Codecademy, you understand some flavors of gobbledygook, but to you a computer is just a magical machine that somehow turns gobbledygook into running software. That isn’t computer literacy.
